# Pink Wordle

**Pink Wordle** is a customizable Wordle clone built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a delightful pink-themed design.

The game follows the classic Wordle rules: players must guess a 5-letter word within 6 attempts, receiving feedback after each guess. 
Letters that are correct and in the right position turn green, while letters in the word but in the wrong position turn yellow. Incorrect letters are shown in gray.

Unlike the official game, Pink Wordle offers unlimited play, drawing from a large word list to provide a new word each round. You can play as many times as you like, whenever you want.

This project was inspired by my friend's desire to play a pink-themed Wordle game that wasnâ€™t restricted to just once per day.
